## GigaGAN - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511">GigaGAN</a> <a href="https://mingukkang.github.io/GigaGAN/">(project page)</a>, new SOTA GAN out of Adobe. I may also add a few findings from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan">lightweight gan</a>, for further stability during training.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a> for the sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source artificial intelligence.

- <a href="https://huggingface.co/">🤗 Huggingface</a> for their accelerate library

- All the maintainers at <a href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip">OpenClip</a>, for their SOTA open sourced contrastive learning text-image models
